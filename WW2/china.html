<p>Yet the Chinese hung on, and after Pearl Harbor, the war became genuinely global. The western Allies and China were now united in their war against Japan.The relationship between the two sides became closer but was also subject to many misunderstandings.China was treated as one of the Allies.</p>

<p>However, the country had far fewer resources than the other Allies, and this led a real divergence in the viewpoints of the west and China toward the Chinese contribution to the war.</p>

<p>Western Allies valued the fact that the Chinese resistance was holding down 600,000 or more Japanese troops.</p>
<p>In the early part of the war, this meant that those troops could therefore not be transferred to the rest of Asia easily. Yet the U.S. and Britain knew they had to prioritize their goals.</p>
<br>

<p>China is increasingly resentful of the U.S.' role in Asia, arguing that if American contributions to the defeat of Japan in 1945 entitle it to a continuing presence in the region, then China's own sacrifices also grant it a role.
