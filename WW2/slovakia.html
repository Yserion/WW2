<p>The newly formed Slovak Republic during World War II was occupied by Germany and forced to cooperate with members of the Axis. The Slovak State (also the first state of the Slovaks was founded with the help of Nazi Germany. After the Slovak-Hungarian War Hungary annexed a great part of the country. In 1940, under pressure from Germany, Slovakia joined the Axis.</p>

<p>The desire for autonomy was one of the great causes for Slovaks in Czechoslovakia. Monsignor Jozef Tiso and nationalists of the Slovak People's Party pushed for Slovak independence and aligned themselves with the Nazi Party in Germany. On March 13, 1939, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler invited Tiso to Berlin. Hitler told Tiso that he would support him if he separated Slovakia from Czecho-Slovakia; otherwise, the Slovak lands would be divided between Hungary, Poland and the rest of Czecho-Slovakia. On March 14, 1939 Slovakia declared independence, calling itself the Slovak Republic. German troops soon occupied the Czech lands, and established the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia there.</p>
<br>

<p>After signing the Peace Treaty of Paris, Slovakia lost its independence and was reunified with the Czech Republic. Hungarian and Czechoslovak authorities (under Soviet influence) forced an exchange of population. </p>
